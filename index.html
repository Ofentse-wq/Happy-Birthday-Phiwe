    <h1>Happy Birthday Phiweee! 🎉</h1><div class="message-box">
  <!-- unchanged message content -->
 Welcome to something made just for you. It’s not perfect, but it’s real. Just like your smile.😘💖
</p>
Now you probably won't remember this, but I asked for your email address a few months ago. You never asked why, which surprised me🤔. Welllll, I wanted it because I wanted to send this through email, since I can't physically give you a gift this year, so I wanted to be creative, and the idea that came to mind was to make you a website for your birthday. The problem was that I had no idea how to make a website, so I had to teach myself how to do it first and wow, I wasn't expecting it to be this hard to make, not gonna lie.😭I had no idea what I was doing half the time. Still, by then, I was already committed to making this website🥲, so I wasn't giving up if it meant it was for you😤💗.  
</p>
Today's your day, and I hope you know how much you deserve to be celebrated. Not just for the birthday part, but for everything you've been, everything you've pushed through, and everything you're becoming, and can you believe that we are turning 20 next year, kuyafana nokuthi we are reaching our thirties phela manje🥲😭 
</p>
You once opened up to me about those tough years in school. About how someone in your class tried to make you feel small, how they emotionally bullied you just because you were quiet, because you moved through the world differently. I remember you saying how one comment got to you so deeply that you went home and cried that night. That one stuck with me.  
</p>
No one should ever have made you feel that way. Not then, not ever. And yet, here you are. Softer, wiser, kinder even after everything you went through, but with all that still in your story. 
</p>
You've got this quiet, gentle resilience about you. A way of making people feel seen. A softness that feels rare. You've always had it, even when someone tried to make you believe otherwise. I'm proud of how far you've come.
And actually, this is gonna sound crazy, there are moments I've wanted just to come out and say that I love you. But instead, I sit with it quietly, hoping you feel it anyway in the way I show up, in the way I listen, in the way I never get tired of you.🥲😅
</p>
Another thing, I know you're gonna probably go to university next year, and I can't lie, I'm excited for you. You're gonna kill it there, no doubt. But if I'm gonna be real with you kancane, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little scared too. What if you meet some guy who sweeps you off your feet, and I'd never tell you who to like, but I just need you to know… that would sting, because you mean that much to me.
</p>
So today, I want to say, happy birthday to someone who's grown so beautifully through it all. I hope your day is filled with the calm you deserve, your favourite music in the background, and hopefully uthule at least upopcorn, u-ice cream noma ngisho amaWings for your birthday 😂😭❤️. And one more thing, the songs that are playing on this website are those you gave me when I asked you for a list of your favourite songs...well, some of them are, I combined your favourite songs with my favourite songs.😘❤️
